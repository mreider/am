## Problem statement

The change-status command works well, but it is hard to understand and it does not include archive features.

## Possible solution

Put a line of examples in the instructions:

Enter story # number and status (u)nplanned, (p)lanned, (d)oing, (f)inished, (a)rchive 
or e to exit (example: 1 f changes #1 to finished):


Also, support the (a) archive bit. No need to include it in change-status -s a :)
