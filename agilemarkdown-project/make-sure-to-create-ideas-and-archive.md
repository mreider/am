# Make sure to create ideas and archive

## Problem statement

I downloaded the latest version and installed. When I run create-backlog I do not get an idea nor archive
folder created. I guess we don't need an archive folder unless there are things to archive, but we need
an ideas folder up front so that outside users know where to put new ideas.
