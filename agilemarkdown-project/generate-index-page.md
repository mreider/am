# Generate index page

## Problem statement

There is no index page. The Home.md was just for gollum, and poorly designed.

## Possible solution

Look at the current index page and re-generate the backlogs section every time. It should have list of backlogs (with archives underneath) and a link to the ideas page at the end. If the user changes the title (#) or the description, that's ok. We should generate this text though as a default.
