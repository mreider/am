## Problem statement

There is no index page. The Home.md was just for gollum, and poorly designed.

## Possible solution

Look at the current index page and re-generate the backlogs section every time. It should have list of backlogs (with archives underneath) and a link to the ideas page at the end. If the user changes the title (#) or the description, that's ok. We should generate this text though as a default.

## Comments

 @falconandy new bit for you

 @mreider Ready for testing

 @falconandy Can you put a horizontal rule to separate the backlogs in the list? (I think `---` is an <hr> in Markdown)
