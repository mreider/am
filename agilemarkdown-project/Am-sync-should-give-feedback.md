## Problem statement

Am sync works great, but it gives no feedback about what is happening.

## Possible solution

When a user runs am sync they should see in stdout the things that are happening, in the order they are happening.

For instance:

Generating project page
Generating tag page
Generating user pages
Generating idea pages
Generating velocity graph
Creating user matt reider
Sending email to john smith
Pushing changes to git
Sync successful
