## Problem statement

If I assign a user to a story, and the user is not created yet, I have to go create the user file by hand

## Possible solution

Am sync should check if there are any assigned users that are not either in a filename or have email handles (falconandy seems to resolve to user falconandy@gmail.com - which is cool - I like how you did that already)
