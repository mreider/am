## Problem statement

If I assign a user to a story, and the user is not created yet, I have to go create the user file by hand

## Possible solution

Am sync should check if there are any assigned users that are not either in a filename or have email handles (falconandy seems to resolve to user falconandy@gmail.com - which is cool - I like how you did that already)

## Comments

@mreider Should it work in Pendulum editor in some way?

@falconandy - don't you think it would be better to use am sync? if you assigned a user to "someuser" and there was no user file, you would just create it. That's all. Why do you think pendulum would be helpful?

@mreider - I can create an user file, without user email. So I can't send new comments to him.
Also misprint are possible: there were 3 misprints - falconamdy, falconany and falconadny.
Three new user files for them?
