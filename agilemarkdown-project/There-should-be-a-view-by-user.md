# There should be a view by user

Project: Agilemarkdown-project

[home](../index.md) • [idea list](../ideas.md) • [tag list](../tags.md) • [velocity](../velocity.md) • [timeline](../timeline.md) • [project page](../agilemarkdown-project.md) • [archive](archive.md)

Tags: users  
Status: planned  
Assigned: falconandy  
Estimate: 3  

## Problem statement

We can see stories by status, by tag, and by idea, but not by user.

## Possible solution

There should be a page to see all of a users work listed by project and then status (doing, planned, unplanned, finished). This is a top level page across backlogs because a user can work on many projects.

Archived stories should not appear.

Also, on all the tables that list stories (tags, project page, idea page with story links) the user name should link to that user’s page.

There should also be a top level page “users” that lists all of the users, across backlogs, in a table, with their name (links to their page), and their email address is available.
