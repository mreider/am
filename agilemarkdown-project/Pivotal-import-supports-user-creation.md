## Problem statement

When I import a Pivotal csv I have to create all the users separately

## Possible solution

Look at the columns in the pivotal csv that contain user names and create user files for each one.

@falconandy I am also noticing that "assigned" does not show the user that is assigned to the story. Do you still have the Pivotal csv?
