@falconandy I notice there is a png in this directory, we should generate them in a subdirectory I think. Also, what will you name the different files by project since there's more than one?

@mreider I added a new 'velocity' subdirectory with velocity images for all backlogs

@falconandy also, could you change the X axis to have mm-dd of the weeks, rather than -N weeks prior.

@mreider mm-dd should be: "July-02 - July-08" (from Monday to Sunday), "July-01 - July-07" (from Sunday to Saturday), "June-28 - July-04" (sliding week) or something else?

@falconandy just the day of the Sunday, or the Monday, like "July 08" is fine.

@mreider done - now it's a Sunday date of a week
