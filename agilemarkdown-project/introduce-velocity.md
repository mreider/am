@falconandy I notice there is a png in this directory, we should generate them in a subdirectory I think. Also, what will you name the different files by project since there's more than one?

@falconandy also, could you change the X axis to have mm-dd of the weeks, rather than -N weeks prior.

@mreider I added a new 'velocity' subdirectory with velocity images for all backlogs
