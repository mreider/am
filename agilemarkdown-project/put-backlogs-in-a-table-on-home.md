# Put backlogs in a table on home

Project: Agilemarkdown-project

[home](../index.md) • [idea list](../ideas.md) • [tag list](../tags.md) • [velocity](../velocity.md) • [timeline](../timeline.md) • [project page](../agilemarkdown-project.md) • [archive](archive.md)

## Problem statement

The format of the home page needs
A table

## Possible solution

Instead of listing the backlogs separated by a horizontal rule (hr tag) it would look better to list them in a table with two columns - one for the backlog name, other column for the archive link.
