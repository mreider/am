## Problem Overview

We built this for Gollum but it could be used for other git based wiki's as well. There are a few others, and we may want to switch at some point.

## Potential solution

Instead of generating content for the Home and Sidebar pages, let's just generate project pages in the root directory and let the Wiki owner put whatever they want to on the Home and Sidebar pages.

Since the progress graph is useful, let's put that at the top of the project page, instead of on the home page.

## Comments

  @falconandy this is a new one for the planned list.
