Estimate: 2  

## Problem statement

We can’t see how many points, in total, are in a sprint, or how many are assigned to each user.

## Possible solution

Put a “total points” row in the project page under the “doing” and the “planned” sections. No need to put these in finished or unplanned.

Put two “total points” rows in the list of stories on the idea page - same as the project page.

Put two “total points” rows on the user page, same as the project page, for each project.

Put “total points” rows in the command line tools under ‘am work’ same as project page.
