# Links should include folders

## Problem statement

None of the links on the overview pages have folder names in them. This works ok with Gollum, on Github Wiki, but it will not work with other servers, since the files are in a subdirectory for the project.

## Possible solution

Let's not worry about Gollum. Let's put the subdirectory name in there so the links work properly.
