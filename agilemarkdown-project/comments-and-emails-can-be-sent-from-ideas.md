## Problem statement

People suggesting ideas would like to send comments as well

## Possible solution

Create a comment section in the ideas template, both via am create-idea and pendulum, and send emails the same way you do for stories.

## Comments

@falconandy I saw you made a commit here, but it doesn't work to email folks from ideas, only stories.

@mreider Should work. In 'Comments' section only (case-insensitive)
