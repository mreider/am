## Problem statement

One story can have multiple tags. So one story can also have multiple start/end dates by forecast.

This means that ‘am timeline’ will create a timeline for each tag.

So forecast_start_[tag]: date etc.

## Possible solution

## Comments

@falconandy - I think I made a mistake here. The story will start / end at the same time, but it can appear on more than one timeline by tag. So instead of the story having more than one start / end date, it should be available on more than one timeline - but keep the same start / end. You are free to change the metadata to get us the right functionality here.
