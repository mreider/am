# Stories can be on more than one timeline

Project: Agilemarkdown-project

[home](../index.md) • [idea list](../ideas.md) • [tag list](../tags.md) • [velocity](../velocity.md) • [timeline](../timeline.md) • [project page](../agilemarkdown-project.md) • [archive](archive.md)

Tags: Timelines  
Status: doing  
Assigned: falconandy  
Estimate: 3  

## Problem statement

One story can have multiple tags. So one story can also have multiple start/end dates by forecast.

This means that ‘am timeline’ will create a timeline for each tag.

So forecast_start_[tag]: date etc.
