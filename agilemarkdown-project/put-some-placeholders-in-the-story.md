# Put some placeholders in the story

## Problem statement

When a user types `am create-item` they have to type the title and subheadings for the story each time. It would be better to put these placeholders in the story automatically

## Possible solution

We could follow the same patterns that you can see here, in this story.
- There should be a line break after the markdown metatdata,
- followed by the title (one #) that is the same as the title of the story in the markdown metadata followed by a line break.
- Then there should be two subheadings (two #'s) separated by a line break each.
