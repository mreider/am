## Problem statement

Pages would make more sense if the title of a story was at the top as a title header # like this, with the metadata afterwards,
followed by the problem statement

## Possible solution

We can parse that header line as the title, rather than the title: key
Put the metadata below the header in the idea.md as well as the idea pages as well as the archive page as well
