## Problem statement

Pages would make more sense if the title of a story was at the top as a title header # like this, with the metadata afterwards,
followed by the problem statement

## Possible solution

We can parse that header line as the title, rather than the title: key
Put the metadata below the header in the idea.md as well as the idea pages as well as the archive page as well


## Comments
 @mreider Ready for testing

 @falconandy look at project/agilemarkdown-project.md and you will see twice the created / modified. This might just be that your old page had this above, and you keep regenerating it when you commit it. I removed it but it keeps getting overwritten:
