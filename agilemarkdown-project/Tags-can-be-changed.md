## Problem statement

Changing a tag is a very manual process.

## Possible solution

A new command

‘’’
am change-tag [old tag] [new tag]
Tag changed
Sync to regenerate files
‘’’

This will change tags from an old tag to a new tag. It will also change the forecast dates for all the tags.

This is not case sensitive. Tags never are.

If the tag already exists, replace all the tags, but make sure the stories don’t have two of the same tag.
