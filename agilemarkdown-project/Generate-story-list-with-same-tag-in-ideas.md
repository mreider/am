## Problem statement

An idea might have a bunch of associated stories. It’s nice to see them, but you have to go to the tag list, and see them there. It would be nicer to see related stories directly in the idea page.

## Possible solution

When am sync runs, see if an idea’s tag has related stories and create a table of stories, in order of status: finished, doing, planned, and unplanned, with a status column next to the title column. Titles should be links to the stories.
