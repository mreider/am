## Problem statement

If you look at wiki.js you will see that it properly handles subdirectories, whereas Gollum (github wiki) does not. This is preferable. The problem is that all the links we are creating do not include the subdirectory, so they are broken links from the project page

## Possible solution

User directory names in the links on the project page.
