## Problem statement

I keep removing these files, but I think they get regenerated automatically when I run `am sync`

## Possible solution

Stop generating them and remove them from this repo

## Comments

 @falconandy sound ok?

 @mreider They shouldn't be (re)generated since a commit "Implemented "Make things generic" Andrey Sokolov 11.05.18 22:24".
I've removed them.
