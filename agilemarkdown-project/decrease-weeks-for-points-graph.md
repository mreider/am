# Problem statement

The points graph is too wide to show up nicely on the home page.

# Potential solution

12 weeks seemed like a fine amount of time, but perhaps we can decrease the number of weeks, or change the size of the graph if possible. If it's not possible, that's ok too. Not a crucial story.

# Comments

  @mreider The width is decreased from 84 symbols to 60.
  @falconandy now that I am moving away from Github, you can put it back to 84. Sorry for the busy work.
