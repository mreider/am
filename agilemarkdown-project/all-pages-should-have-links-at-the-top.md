## Problem statement

It's hard to navigate around

## Possible solution

After the header of a page, and before the metadata (if there is any) we should have links

All of the pages should be generated with links: stories, project page, ideas page, archive page, tag pages
Index already has links so don't worry about that one.

This means that archived story links will have to change when they are archived / unarchived.

Links will be next to one another

[project](link) [archive](link) [ideas](link) [index](link)

## Comments

 @falconandy some changes:
- let's make these more descriptive and change the order: "home" (was index) "project page" "idea list" "tag list"
- let's separate each link with a couple of spaces and "||" i.e. "home  ||  project page  ||  idea list ||  tag list"
- the links should be above the header in the Archive page - also get rid of the ":" next to the Archive header
- add these links to the top of the index page too, just like everywhere else
- the links should look the same on every page. They are not all on the "Tags" page the same way they should be
- They are also not all on the ideas page

- the links should be above the header in the Archive page - also get rid of the ":" next to the Archive header  
Why above the header in the Archive Page? For all other pages the links are below - the links should be above the header in the Archive page - also get rid of the ":" next to the Archive header

- add these links to the top of the index page too, just like everywhere else  
- the links should look the same on every page. They are not all on the "Tags" page the same way they should be  
- They are also not all on the ideas page  
The index, ideas and tags page are not for a specific project - I can't add the 'project page' link, only links for all projects/archives  
Should I add a self-referenced link to each page - so the index page will contain the "home" link?
