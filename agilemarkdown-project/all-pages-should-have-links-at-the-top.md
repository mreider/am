# All pages should have links at the top

## Problem statement

It's hard to navigate around

## Possible solution

After the header of a page, and before the metadata (if there is any) we should have links

All of the pages should be generated with links: stories, project page, ideas page, archive page, tag pages
Index already has links so don't worry about that one.

This means that archived story links will have to change when they are archived / unarchived.

Links will be next to one another

[project](link) [archive](link) [ideas](link) [index](link)
